## PERSONAL INJURY LITIGATION

PERSONAL INJURY LITIGATION arises out of situations when the accidental or negligent conduct of one individual or entity causes injury or other damages to another individual. Typical situations involving injuries include automobile accidents, trucking accidents, slips and falls, dog bites, confrontations, or other traumatic events. If you are injured by the negligent or intentional conduct of another person or entity, you will likely incur large medical bills, miss time at work, and experience other harms that affect you and your family in ways you never imagined possible. A delicate balance is necessary when dealing with the welfare of an injured individual while aggressively pursuing a claim against the negligent party. A lawyer must have tremendous skill to properly present all aspects of a personal injury case to a jury, and persuade a jury to make an award to balance the harm done to an injured individual.

John Clune is primarily responsible for Personal Injury Litigation. John has devoted his career to helping victims who have been injured due to the negligence of others. This dedication includes the aggressive and dogged pursuit of his clientâ€™s claims in front of judges and juries. John has recovered millions of dollars for his clients through settlements and verdicts in Southern California. If a settlement is unattainable, John will work with his clients to develop an effective Trial strategy to aggressively pursue the clientâ€™s claims at Trial. Many of the cases that John accepts are referrals from other attorneys who know that John will not hesitate to take a case to Trial if settlement negotiations break down. Just as these referring attorneys do, you can trust that John has what it takes to go to Trial and win.

Personal Injury cases are generally taken on a contingent fee basis. If there is no recovery, there is no fee. We offer free initial consultations to determine whether a case has merit. Contact us if you have been injured due to the negligent conduct of another.

## BUSINESS LITIGATION

BUSINESS LITIGATION arises out of disputes between or among participants in a business transaction or relationship. Ranging from a dispute in a simple business agreement to provide products or services, to a dispute among partners in a large business, these disputes can be very basic or very complex. Despite the complexity, the resolution of any dispute requires careful attention to the needs of the client and the development of a strategy which best satisfies these needs, while taking into account the overall context of the situation.

CONTRACT LAW is involved in almost every aspect of your everyday life. Oral and written agreements form the basis of working with those around you.

Unfortunately, disputes sometimes arise in fulfilling the terms of these agreements, and legal intervention is necessary.

## INSURANCE LITIGATION

INSURANCE is prevalent in today’s society. Whether it is personal automobile insurance coverage, homeowner’s insurance coverage, or business insurance coverage, insurance companies are paid premiums to protect their insureds’ interests. If insurance coverage is in place and a claim for damages is made against an insured, the insurance company will normally provide a legal defense to its insureds and provide coverage to the insureds based on the terms of the policy of insurance. At times, disputes may arise between the insurance company and those paying for the insurance, the insureds.

The attorneys at The Provan Clune law Firm have spent many years defending those insureds who have been sued, and confirming the rights, duties, and obligations of both the insurance companies and their insureds. A premium is placed on the careful analysis of the needs of the client , whether it be the insured or the insurance company. While every effort is made to avoid unnecessary and costly litigation, we certainly will aggressively pursue and defend claims in the best interests of our clients. Further, legal counseling regarding the procurement of the appropriate insurance coverage may be necessary. In any event, the client comes first at The Provan Clune Law Firm.

## PREMISES LIABILITY

PREMISES LIABILITY arises out of accidents which occur on the property of a business or residence due to the negligence of the property owner. Injuries and other damages may be caused by dangerous conditions due to inadequate maintenance, unsafe property management, or the actual negligent conduct of the property owner. These dangerous conditions may result in slip and fall injuries, dog bites, injuries from falling debris, and even injuries from personal confrontations occurring on the property. Many times, property owners are the targets of unscrupulous individuals who may have been injured but through no fault of the property owner.

The Provan Clune Law Firm prides itself in carefully analyzing the needs of its clients, both in pursuing meritorious claims against property owners, and defending those property owners who are sued.

## RISK MANAGEMENT

Both individuals and businesses must manage risk on a daily basis. Intelligent assessment regarding exposure to liability and resulting litigation is a constant challenge, and a determination of the necessity of the appropriate insurance coverage is important to provide adequate protection for these potential risks. Homeowners are wise to obtain ample insurance protection so that personal assets are not at risk. Business owners must maintain a safe working environment and have programs in place to minimize injuries and other damages to property, so that liability exposure is minimized. Appropriate insurance coverage not only protects personal and business assets, but also minimizes legal fees and costs associated with litigation.

The Provan Clune Law Firm has counseled numerous businesses and individuals in the area of RISK MANAGEMENT and insurance coverage. We pride ourselves on identifying the specific issue and addressing the need for insurance, while accurately assessing the risks to our clients.
